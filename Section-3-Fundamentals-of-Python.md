## Lists <hr><br>

* A List can contain a mix of data types
* A list can have nested list
* In Python 3 , range is an iterator

## SLICING
* slice the list very quickly
* first : last
* Advance Slicing - first : last : step

## Tuples
* Immutable sequence of values 

## Functions
* max function
* min function 
* range function
* random function

## Packages 
* In packages we have different functions, we also have classes but we will mainly discuss here functions
* Module - a module is simply a file containing python definition, functions, and statements. Putting code into modules is useful because of the ability to import module
functionality into your script or IPython session(e:g ; Jupyter Notebook)
* Package - A Package is a way of collecting related modules together within a single tree-like hierarchy. Very complex packages like NumPy or SciPy have hundreds of 
individual modules so putting them into a directory-like structure keep things organized and avoid name collisions
